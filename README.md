Hey, I’m Mark, a sophomore Computer Science major at Iowa State University.

I’m the Software Lead for Robot In 3 Days and a telemetry programmer for the PrISUm Solar Car team.

I primarily program in C++, but I enjoy exploring a variety of languages. Currently, I’m focused on integrating machine learning with robotics.
